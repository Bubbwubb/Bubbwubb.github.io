            <p>
                I have recreated the hit game "Asteroids", if you have ever played it before you will know what it's about. If not, 
                you controll a small ship and have to blast all the asteroids! Clearing all moves to the next level.

                    Controls
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Using the arrow keys, you can steer the ship and activate the thrusters.

                    Pressing down on the spacebar will fire the blaster.

                    Scoring
                </h3>
                <p>
                    You get points for every asteroid you blast, and then points for the smaller chunks that break off.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This game was made using P5 and it's functionality. The ship and rocks were made using P5 to generate geometry.
                    The sound was made using ToneJS and audio samples.
                </p>
                <h3>

                If I continued to work on this game, all I would add is proper sound to make it work. Unfortunately, I just didnt have time 
                to implement the sound correctly. When attempting to add sound, it made the entire thing not work. I included the copy of the
                attempted audio code in my code submission.
